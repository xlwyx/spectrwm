--- spectrwm ---
The spectrwm window manager was inspired by xmonad and dwm. It shares several characteristics of dwm and has several nice features of its own, things that I always had to add to dwm with scripts or patches. The downside of that is that it's a bit bigger, with more dependencies, than dwm, but even on an old machine, it would be considered a very lightweight and fast window manager.

It was originally named scrotwm. Whether the humor was amusing, infantile, or both can be left to the judgement of the reader. Some people were offended and eventually the name was changed to spectrwm.

After installation, a default spectrwm.conf is created. If building from source, it will be in the spectrwm directory created after untarring the tarball. In Ubuntu based systems, as well as Fedora, it's /etc/spectrwm.conf. In FreeBSD it's /usr/local/etc/spectrwm.conf
